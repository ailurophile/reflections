What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
This creates a new empty repository which one needs to start tracking commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The repository holds a subset of files contained in the working directory.  The staging area holds files intended 
to be included included in the repository.  It allows one to aggregate multiple files into a single commit.
