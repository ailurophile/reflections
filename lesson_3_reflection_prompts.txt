When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working on the project from multiple locations or with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It would be disconcerting to have your code base changed without your being aware.  It may not be a convenient time for
you to make such a change causing conflicts which you might not wish to address at that particular time.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork makes a copy of a repository on GitHub which you might want to do should you want to make changes & suggest those
changes for the original repository. Clone makes a copy of a repository on your local drive which you would do if you
wanted the program for your own personal use.  Branch allows one to make changes without affecting the master copy of 
a program which is good when making major changes which you may or may not want to keep.
